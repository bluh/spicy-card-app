# Introduction
[SteelHacks](http://steelhacks.com/) is a MLH event hosted in Pittsburgh, PA. As participants in the event, we worked on an Android app which would replace physical playing card decks.
# Features
* Generalized to emulate physical packs of cards
* Connectivity through Bluetooth to other devices
* Genuine Hackathon charm
# Process
Given limited time and experience with development of mobile apps, not all of this could be accomplished. We managed to create a framework for card objects that could be shared between clients and the server. Additionally, Bluetooth connectivity was partially implemented, such that devices pair together in a basic client-server model. And, in true Hackathon fashion, we learned a lot.
